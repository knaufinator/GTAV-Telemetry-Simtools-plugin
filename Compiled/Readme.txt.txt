1) install scripthookv
2) install scripthookvdotnet
3) copy GTAScriptHookPlugin.dll into the "scripts" folder (create it..) within your GTAV directory
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\scripts"

4) copy  GrandTheftAutoV_GamePlugin.dll into the simtools plugin directory... i have not bothered checking if it installs using normal methods...reopen simtools, and it should appear in the list. patch as normal...
C:\Users\userName\AppData\Local\SimTools\GamePlugins

5) open gtav, telemetry is triggered when game protaginist enters vehicle... it should work with the jets as well... and .. boats .. and sub,.... but i have not tried yet.

note,... you will need to set up min max limits using the tuner, they will default to 0's
